About
=====

This project aims to create a markdown-pandoc process that requires latex in producing a thesis.
This is specifically designed for the National University of Singapore.

This approach makes use of the Pandoc-Scholar program.  It replaces the template that Pandoc-Scholar
would normally use with this NUS version.


Why Pandoc?
===========

It combines the benefits of markdown while still enabling latex commands and templates.  For more
information, there are plenty of blog posts on why writing in latex alone is not an efficent
approach.
